- Finalized electrical component list so that we can create a PCB for the science module.
- The prospect of building a spectrometer is UP in the air right now. I aim to continue doing research but
had to give very rough power estimates based off other rover teams.
- In the process of creating a python file that controls lower and turns on an augur attached to a linear actuator using a pi.
- Going to try using the Pyserial class, still need to pip install though

Set up raspi and ran perasiltic pump with python. Its controlled like a servo for some reason? CONTROL PUMP WITH 
POWER SUPPLY NOT PI. Need to do more research into the pump though, and test with it more.

Talked with rest of science team and with software about goals. Software will eventually help with analysing data from
spectrometer.
